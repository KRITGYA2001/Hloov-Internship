# Hloov-Internship-Task1
I have successfully created a project named "Maverick IFC visualizer," for Construir Hackathon under my internship with Hloov. I would like to thank my mentor, Ms. Resma Pachikaran for believing in me and my teammate Amit Mishra for his excellent efforts, and my CEO Mr. Suhail Arfath for constantly motivating us to strive to be a better version of ourselves.
